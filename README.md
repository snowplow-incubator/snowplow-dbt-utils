## Macros

There are many macros contained in this package, with the majority designed for use internally at Snowplow.

There are however a selection that were intended for public use and that can assist you in modelling Snowplow data. The documentation for these macros can be found below.

### get_columns_in_relation_by_column_prefix ([source](macros/utils/get_columns_in_relation_by_column_prefix.sql))

This macro returns an array of column objects within a relation that start with the given column prefix. This is useful when you have multiple versions of a column within a table and want to dynamically identify all versions.

**Arguments:**

- `relation`: The relation from which to search for matching columns.
- `column_prefix`: The column prefix to search for.

**Returns:**

- An array of [column objects][dbt-column-objects]. The name of each column can be accessed with the name property.

**Usage:**

```sql
{% set matched_columns = snowplow_utils.get_columns_in_relation_by_column_prefix(
                          relation=ref('snowplow_web_base_events_this_run'),
                          column_prefix='custom_context_1_0_'
                          ) %}

{% for column in matched_columns %}
  {{ column.name }}
{% endfor %}

# Renders to something like:
'custom_context_1_0_1'
'custom_context_1_0_2'
'custom_context_1_0_3'
```

The order of the matched columns is denoted by their ordinal position.

### combine_column_versions ([source](macros/utils/bigquery/combine_column_versions.sql))

*BigQuery Only.* This macro is designed primarily for combining versions of custom context or an unstructured event column from the Snowplow events table in BigQuery.

As your schemas for such columns evolve, multiple versions of the same column will be created in your events table e.g. `custom_context_1_0_0`, `custom_context_1_0_1`. These columns contain nested fields i.e. are of a datatype `RECORD`. When modeling Snowplow data it can be useful to combine or coalesce each nested field across all versions of the column for a continuous view over time. This macro mitigates the need to update your coalesce statement each time a new version of the column is created.

Fields can be selected using 3 methods:

- Select all fields. Default.
- Select by field name using the `required_fields` arg.
- Select all fields at a given level/depth of nesting e.g. all 1st level fields. Uses the `nested_level` arg.

By default any returned fields will be assigned an alias matching the field name e.g. `coalesce(<col_v2>.product, <col_v1>.product) as product`. For heavily nested fields, the alias will be field's path with `.` replaced with `_` e.g. for a field `product.size.height` will have an alias `product_size_height`. A custom alias can be supplied with the `required_fields` arg (see below).

**Arguments:**

- `relation`: The relation from which to search for matching columns.
- `column_prefix`: The column prefix to search for.
- `required_fields`: Optional. List of fields to return. For fields nested deeper than the 1st level specify the path using dot notation e.g. `product.name`. To use a custom field alias, pass a tuple containing the field name and alias e.g. `(<field_name>, <field_alias>)`.
- `nested_level`: Optional. The level from which to return fields e.g. `1` to return all 1st level fields. Behaviour can be changed to comparison using `level_filter` arg.
- `level_filter`: Default `equalto`. Accepted values `equalto`, `lessthan`, `greaterthan`. Used in conjunction with `nested_level` to determine which fields to return.
- `relation_alias`: Optional. The alias of the relation containing the column. If passed the alias will be prepended to the full path for each field e.g. `<relation_alias>.<column>.<field>`. Useful when your desired column occurs in multiple relations within your model.
- `include_field_alias`: Default `True`. Determines whether to included the field alias in the final coalesced field e.g. `coalesce(...) as <field_alias>`. Useful when using the field as part of a join.
- `array_index`: Default 0. If the column is of mode `REPEATED` i.e. an array, this determines the element to take. All Snowplow context columns are arrays, typically with only a single element.
- `max_nested_level`: Default 15. Imposes a hard stop for recursions on heavily nested data.

**Returns:**

- An array, with each item being a string of coalesced paths to a field across each version of the column. The order of the coalesce is determined by the version of the column, with the latest taking precedent.

**Usage:**

The following examples assumes two 'product' context columns with the following schemas:

![Example nested fields](./assets/nested_fields.png)

**All fields**

```sql
{%- set all_fields = snowplow_utils.combine_column_versions(
                                relation=ref('snowplow_web_base_events_this_run'),
                                column_prefix='product_v'
                                ) -%}

select
{% for field in all_fields %}
  {{field}} {%- if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

# Renders to:
select
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].name, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].name) as name,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].specs) as specs,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs.power_rating, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].specs.power_rating) as specs_power_rating,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs.volume) as specs_volume,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs.accessories, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].specs.accessories) as specs_accessories
```

Note fields within `accessories` are not unnested as `accessories` is of mode `REPEATED`. See limitations section below.

**Fields filtered by name**

```sql
{%- set required_fields = snowplow_utils.combine_column_versions(
                                relation=ref('snowplow_web_base_events_this_run'),
                                column_prefix='product_v',
                                required_fields=['name', ('specs.power_rating', 'product_power_rating')]
                                ) -%}

select
{% for field in required_fields %}
  {{field}} {%- if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

# Renders to:
select
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].name, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].name) as name,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs.power_rating, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].specs.power_rating) as product_power_rating
```

Note we have renamed the power rating field by passing a tuple of the field name and desired field alias.

**Fields filtered by level**

```sql
{%- set fields_by_level = snowplow_utils.combine_column_versions(
                                relation=ref('snowplow_web_base_events_this_run'),
                                column_prefix='product_v',
                                nested_level=1
                                ) -%}

select
{% for field in fields_by_level %}
  {{field}} {%- if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

# Renders to:
select
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].name, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].name) as name,
  coalesce(product_v2[safe_offset(0)].specs, product_v1[safe_offset(0)].specs) as specs
```

**Limitations**

- If a field is of the data type `RECORD` and a mode `REPEATED`, i.e. an array of structs, it's sub/nested fields will not be unnested.

### is_run_with_new_events ([source](macros/utils/is_run_with_new_events.sql))

This macro is designed for use with Snowplow data modelling packages like `snowplow-web`. It can be used in any incremental models, to effectively block the incremental model from being updated with old data which it has already consumed. This saves cost as well as preventing historical data from being overwritten with partially complete data (due to a batch back-fill for instance).

The macro utilizes the `snowplow_[platform]_incremental_manifest` table to determine whether the model from which the macro is called, i.e. `{{ this }}`, has already consumed the data in the given run. If it has, it returns `false`. If the data in the run contains new data, `true` is returned.

**Arguments:**

- `package_name`: The modeling package name i.e. `snowplow-mobile`.

**Returns:**

- Boolean. `true` if the run contains new events previously not consumed by `this`, `false` otherwise.

**Usage:**

```sql
{{ 
  config(
    materialized='snowplow_incremental',
    unique_key='screen_view_id',
    upsert_date_key='start_tstamp'
  ) 
}}

select
  ...

from {{ ref('snowplow_mobile_base_events_this_run' ) }}
where {{ snowplow_utils.is_run_with_new_events('snowplow_mobile') }} --returns false if run doesn't contain new events.
```

### snowplow_web_delete_from_manifest ([source](macros/utils/snowplow_delete_from_manifest.sql))

The `snowplow-web` package makes use of a centralised manifest system to record the current state of the package. There may be times when you want to remove the metadata associated with particular models from the manifest, for instance to replay events through a particular model.

This can be performed as part of the run-start operation of the snowplow-web package, as described in the [docs][snowplow-web-docs]. You can however perform this operation independently using the `snowplow_web_delete_from_manifest` macro.

**Arguments:**

- `models`: Either an array of models to delete, or a string for a single model.

**Usage:**

```bash
dbt run-operation snowplow_web_delete_from_manifest --args "models: ['snowplow_web_page_views','snowplow_web_sessions']"
# or
dbt run-operation snowplow_web_delete_from_manifest --args "models: snowplow_web_page_views"
```

### snowplow_mobile_delete_from_manifest ([source](macros/utils/snowplow_delete_from_manifest.sql))

The `snowplow-mobile` package makes use of a centralised manifest system to record the current state of the package. There may be times when you want to remove the metadata associated with particular models from the manifest, for instance to replay events through a particular model.

This can be performed as part of the run-start operation of the snowplow-mobile package, as described in the [docs][snowplow-mobile-docs]. You can however perform this operation independently using the `snowplow_mobile_delete_from_manifest` macro.

**Arguments:**

- `models`: Either an array of models to delete, or a string for a single model.

**Usage:**

```bash
dbt run-operation snowplow_mobile_delete_from_manifest --args "models: ['snowplow_mobile_screen_views','snowplow_mobile_sessions']"
# or
dbt run-operation snowplow_mobile_delete_from_manifest --args "models: snowplow_mobile_screen_views"
```

### get_value_by_target ([source](macros/utils/get_value_by_target.sql))

This macro is designed to dynamically return values based on the target (`target.name`) you are running against. Your target names are defined in your [profiles.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml) file. This can be useful for dynamically changing variables within your project, depending on whether you are running in dev or prod.

**Arguments:**

- `dev_value`: The value to be returned if running against your dev target, as defined by `dev_target_name`.
- `default_value`: The default value to return, if not running against your dev target.
- `dev_target_name`: Default: `dev`. The name of your dev target as defined in your `profiles.yml` file.

**Usage:**

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
vars:
  snowplow_web:
    snowplow__backfill_limit_days: "{{ snowplow_utils.get_value_by_target(dev_value=1, default_value=30, dev_target_name='dev') }}"
```

**Returns:**

- `dev_value` if running against your dev target, otherwise `default_value`.

### n_timedeltas_ago ([source](macros/utils/n_timedeltas_ago.sql))

This macro takes the current timestamp and subtracts `n` units, as defined by the `timedelta_attribute`, from it. This is achieved using the Python datetime module, rather than querying your database.

**Arguments:**

- `n`: The number of timedeltas to subtract from the current timestamp.
- `timedelta_attribute`: The type of units to subtract. This can be any valid attribute of the [timedelta](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects) object.

**Usage:**

```sql
{{ snowplow_utils.n_timedeltas_ago(1, 'weeks') }}
```

**Returns:**

- Current timestamp minus `n` units.

By combining this with the `get_value_by_target` macro, you can dynamically set dates depending on your environment:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
vars:
  snowplow_mobile:
    snowplow__start_date: "{{ snowplow_utils.get_value_by_target(
                                      dev_value=snowplow_utils.n_timedeltas_ago(1, 'weeks'),
                                      default_value='2020-01-01', 
                                      dev_target_name='dev') }}"
```

## Materializations

### snowplow_incremental

This package provides a custom incremental materialization, `snowplow_incremental`. This builds upon the out-of-the-box incremental materialization provided by dbt, by limiting the length of the table scans on the destination table. This improves both performance and reduces cost. The following methodology is used to calculate the limit of the table scan:

- The minimum date is found in the `tmp_relation`, based on the `upsert_date_key`
- By default, 30 days are subtracted from this date. This is set by `snowplow__upsert_lookback_days`. We found when modeling Snowplow data, having this look-back period of 30 days can help minimise the chance of introducing duplicates in your destination table. Reducing the number of look-back days will improve performance further but increase the risk of duplicates.
- The look-back can be disabled altogether, by setting `disable_upsert_lookback=true` in your model's config (see below). This is not recommended for most use cases.

As is the case with the native dbt incremental materialization, the strategy varies between adapters.

### Redshift & Postgres ([source](macros/materializations/snowplow_incremental/default/snowplow_incremental.sql))

Like the native materialization, the `snowplow_incremental` materialization strategy is delete and insert however a limit has been imposed on how far to scan the destination table in order to improve performance:

```sql
with vars as (
  select 
    dateadd('day', -{{ snowplow__upsert_lookback_days }}, min({{ upsert_date_key }})) as lower_limit,
    max(upsert_date_key) as upper_limit
  from {{ tmp_relation }}
)

delete
from {{ destination_table }}
where {{ unique_key }} in (select {{ unique_key }} from {{ tmp_relation }})
and {{ upsert_date_key }} between (select lower_limit from vars) and (select upper_limit from vars);

insert into {{ destination_table }}
(select * from {{ tmp_relation }});
```

**Usage:**

```sql
{{ 
  config(
    materialized='snowplow_incremental',
    unique_key='page_veiw_id', # Required: the primary key of your model
    upsert_date_key='start_tstamp' # Required: The date key to be used to calculate the limits
    disable_upsert_lookback=true # Optional. Will disable the look-back period during the upsert to the destination table.
  ) 
}}
```

### BigQuery ([source](macros/materializations/snowplow_incremental/bigquery/snowplow_incremental.sql))

Like the native materialization, the `snowplow_incremental` materialization strategy is [merge](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs#the-merge-strategy) however limits are calculated to allow for partition pruning on the destination table saving cost:

```sql
/*
  Create a temporary table from the model SQL
*/
create temporary table {{ model_name }}__dbt_tmp as (
  {{ model_sql }}
);

/*
  Find merge limits
*/

declare dbt_partition_lower_limit, dbt_partition_upper_limit date;
set (dbt_partition_lower_limit, dbt_partition_upper_limit) = (
    select as struct
         dateadd('day', -{{ snowplow__upsert_lookback_days }}, min({{ partition_by_key }})) as dbt_partition_lower_limit,
         max({{ partition_by_key }}) as dbt_partition_upper_limit
    from {{ model_name }}__dbt_tmp
);

/*
  Update or insert into destination table. Limit the table scan on the destination table.
*/
merge into {{ destination_table }} DEST
using {{ model_name }}__dbt_tmp SRC
on SRC.{{ unique_key }} = DEST.{{ unique_key }}
and DEST.{{ partition_by_key }} between dbt_partition_lower_limit and dbt_partition_upper_limit -- Prune partitions on DEST

when matched then update ...

when not matched then insert ...
```

**Usage:**

```sql
{{ 
  config(
    materialized='snowplow_incremental',
    unique_key='page_view_id', # Required: the primary key of your model
    partition_by = {
      "field": "start_tstamp",
      "data_type": "timestamp",
      "granularity": "day" # Only introduced in dbt v0.19.0+. Defaults to 'day' for dbt v0.18 or earlier
    } # Adds partitions to destination table. This field is also used to determine the upsert limits dbt_partition_lower_limit, dbt_partition_upper_limit
    disable_upsert_lookback=true # Optional. Will disable the look-back period during the upsert to the destination table. 
  ) 
}}
```

**Note you must provide the `partition_by` clause to use this materialization. All `data_types` are supported except `int64`.**

### Snowflake ([source](macros/materializations/snowplow_incremental/snowflake/snowplow_incremental.sql))

Like the native materialization, the `snowplow_incremental` materialization's default strategy is [merge][dbt-snowflake-merge-strategy], however limits are calculated to allow for partition pruning on the destination table saving cost. This is performed in a similar fashion to BigQuery as outlined above.

**Usage:**

```sql
{{ 
  config(
    materialized='snowplow_incremental',
    unique_key='page_view_id', # Required: the primary key of your model
    upsert_date_key='start_tstamp', # Required: The date key to be used to calculate the limits
    cluster_by='to_date(start_tstamp)' # Optional.
  ) 
}}
```

If you have duplicates in your source table, you may find that the merge command returns an error. This is because duplicates produce non-deterministic results as outlined in [Snowflake's docs][snowflake-merge-duplicates]. If you experience this we suggest using the `delete+insert` strategy provided in the `snowplow_incremental` materialization.

To update all incremental models in the package to use this strategy please add the following to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    +incremental_strategy: "delete+insert"
```

*Note: During testing we found that providing the `upsert_date_key` as a cluster key results in more effective partition pruning. This does add overhead however as the dataset needs to be sorted before being upserted. In our testing this was a worthwhile trade off, reducing overall costs. Your mileage may vary, as variables like row count can effect this.*

### Notes

- If using this the `snowplow_incremental` materialization, **the native dbt `is_incremental()` macro will not recognize the model as incremental**. Please use the `snowplow_utils.snowplow_is_incremental()` macro instead, which operates in the same way.
- `snowplow__upsert_lookback_days` defaults to 30 days. If you set `snowplow__upsert_lookback_days` to too short a period, duplicates can occur in your incremental table.
